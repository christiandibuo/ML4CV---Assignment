# ML4CV---Assignment
This repository contains the assignment for the course of Machine Learning for Computer Vision at the University of Bologna
The notebook has been created using Kaggle. All the model training and evaluation have been done with the Kaggle GPU P100.
To ensure reproducibility please upload the notebook on Kaggle, connect to GPU P100 and run the notebook. Please, ensure that on your Kaggle notebook internet connection is enabled.

The model weights, the results directory containing all the evaluation results and the logs directory containing the logs run have been updated on: 
- the institutional OneDrive: https://liveunibo-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/christian_dibuo_studio_unibo_it/EvnP2sxQoNRJqYqPF8YAg-UB37yXA_FhtvWtGmyauVuO8w?e=meYkj7
- my personal Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kWFbMkIBhuJ9Oy5MNQCIu4-2waW9Ut7d?usp=sharing
  
This has been done since institutional OneDrive does not allow to share the link with anyone, but only with those belonging to your institutional group (Unibo, in this case), and on Kaggle
was not possible in any way to automatically download them.
To ensure reproducibility they have been updated also in my personal Google Drive, which allows, using the gdown command, to download all the directories. This has been already done in the first
line of the notebook, the links are already inserted, so nothing of the nootebook needs to be modified. It is already completly reproducible.
